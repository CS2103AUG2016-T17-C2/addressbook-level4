1) By status 
* Active and Expired tasks are at the top,
* Done and Ignored are at the bottom

2) By pin
* pinned tasks are at the top

3) By priority
* tasks with higher priority are at the top

* tasks will be sorted with the earlier date at the top


**Adding tasks**

<img src="images/add.png" width="600"><br>

Task Book supports highly flexible command format. The user can enter command in any order and Task Book intelligently identifies the contents based on keywords and natural language processing.

For example, 
To add a task, type `add` + `taskname` + `from start time` + ` by end time` + `#task_priority` + `#tags` + `@venue`  + `pin status`

* Example: user can type `add` `play soccer` `from tomorrow 2pm` `to 6pm` `#high` `#sport` `@Utown` ` #pin`

```

Dates can be any of the following formats 

`formal dates (02/28/1979)`

`relaxed dates (oct 1st)`

`relative dates (tomorrow, the day before next thursday)`

`and even date alternatives (next wed or thurs)`

`time`: The above date formats may be prefixed or suffixed with time information. 

`Eg: 0600h, 06:00 hours, 6pm, 5:30 a.m., 5, 12:59, 23:59, noon, midnight`

`priority`: Will be `medium` by default. The priority can be of `low`, `medium`, `high`. All keywords are case-insensitive.

`#`: tags. The tags cannot be `high`, `low`, `medium`, `unpin`, `pin` and `null`. These are reserved keywords for other parameters.

`@`: venue. It is also possible to concatenate venues by using `@` as a prefix for the venue names.

`Pin`: indicates whether the task should be pinned.

**Updating tasks**

<img src="images/update.png" width="800"><br>


To update a task type `update` (index of task in the list or name of task) (changes)
* Eg: Typing `update 1 by 12 dec` will change the **deadline** of the first task to 12 December 2016
* Eg: Typing `update 2 @Casa` will change the **venue** of the second task to Casa.
* Eg: Typing `update 1 #high` will change the **task priority** to high
* Eg: Typing `update 1 #unpin` will **unpin** the task

Multiple fields can be updated in a single command
* Eg: Typing `update 2 #high @home` changes the priority of task 2 to high and change the venue to home

**Deleting tasks**

To `delete` a task on the list that is on the screen, type `delete` [ index of task in the list] 
* eg `delete 1 `

`delete` can also be done for multiple tasks
* Eg: `delete 1 2 3` deletes tasks 1,2 and 3.
* Eg: `delete 29 1 7` deletes tasks 29, 1 and 7.

The order of index doesn't matter. 
All the index have to be valid index found in the list. Task Book will feedback the user if it founds to be an invalid index.

**Undo and Redo:**

To undo/redo the latest change to taskbook, simply type `undo`/`redo`.

Actions that can be undone/redone are **adding tasks**, **deleting tasks**, **updating tasks** and **setting task status** 

Undo and Redo also works for deleting multiple tasks.

Undo and Redo can be done multiple times.

**Finding tasks** 

<img src="images/find.png" width="800"><br>

**Creating shortkeys**

<img src="images/shortcut.png" width="400"><br>

To change a shortkey for the command, type `shortcut` + `{the field you are changing}` + `{shortkey you want to initialise}` eg: ``shortcut` `add` `a` changes the shortkey for the command `add` to `a`. The next time you want to execute 'add' to add 'running' to your tasklist, simply type `a running`.

Shortkeys can be set for `add`, `delete` and `list` commands. 

This feature is only available for **Add**, **Delete** and **List**.

<img src="images/move.png" width="800"><br>
