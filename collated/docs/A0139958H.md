This same command can be written in any order. Other alternatives

* Example: user can type `add` `from tomorrow 2pm` `to 6pm` `play soccer` `@Utown` ` #pin` `#high` `#sport`  
* Example: user can type `add` `@Utown` `play soccer`  `from tomorrow 2pm` `to 6pm` `#sport` ` #pin` `#high` 

In addition to that, Task Book also supports parameter within parameter. For example,

* Example: user can type `add` `success party from 6pm to 8pm for compeleting CS2103 project @soc #party #high #pin`

Notice how the start and end dates are contained within the task name. Task Book is able to intelligently seperate task name from other parameters. So, for the above example

`Task Name: success party for compeleting CS2103`

`Start date: 6pm`

`End date: 6pm`

`Venue: soc`

`Priority: high`

`Status: active`

`Pin: true`

`Tags: party`

**Parameters**

`Task Name`: Task names should be AlphaNumeric.

`Date`: Start date has to be followed by the keyword `from`. End date has to be followed by the keyword `by`. If the command contains start date and end date, then alternatively, `from` and `to` can also be used to denote the dates respectively. All keywords are case insensitive.

`Note:` Although `from`, `by`, `to` are keywords for the dates, they can be used in task name as well. Task Book is able to intelligently identify if they mean date or name.

Task Book uses Natty Natural language processing Date parser to identify dates in the command.

```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
`Status`: This is set by Task Book itself when a new task is added. The default value is `Active`. If the task has and end date, then after the end date, Task Book will update the status of task to `Expired` automatically. The user can only set the task status to be `done` or `ignore`.


**Input Validation**

Task Book parses the user input and validates it before performing the requested operation. If it found to be an invalid command, it will feedback the user.

Task Name:

`Task name is a compulsory field`

`Task name should be AlphaNumeric and not null.`

Dates:

`Dates should be an upcoming date.`

`Start date and End date should not be same.`

` There should not be multiple start dates in the input.`

` There should not be multiple end dates in the input.`

` Start Date should be before End Date.`

Tags:

` tag names should be AlphaNumeric and not null.`

` #null is a reserved keyword for removing start date or end date from an exisiting task.`

` cannot have duplicate tags with the same name`

Status:

` Task status can only be updated to Done or Ignore. It is not possible to set to Active or Expired. These are set by TaskBook itself.`

Venue:

` venue can't be null`

If any of the above conditions are voilated, Task Book will not perform the operation and will feedback the user to make the necessary changes.

Furthermore, Task Book also checks for Date clashes with other dates. 

For example, if there's an existing task `from 4pm to 7pm` and a new task to be added anywhere in between `4pm to 7pm`, then Task Book will not add the task and will feedback the user of the date clash.

Task Book feedback the Task name, start date and end date of the task that the new task clashes with. The format is as below.

`The Start Date and End date clashes with another task 'task name' from 'start date' to 'end date'`

However, Task Book allows overlapping of tasks. So, for exampe, a new task can be added `2pm to 5pm` or `from 6pm to 8pm`. This is to give the users some flexibility in their options. 

```

Fields can also be updated to be empty
* Eg: Typing `update 3 @null` removes the venue of the third task in the list. 
* Eg: Typing `update 3 from #null by #null @null` removes the start date, end date and venue of the third task in the list.

Tags can be added/removed as well.
* Eg: Typing `update 3 #sports #healthy` will remove the tags `#sports` and `#healthy` if found. If not, it will add the tags.

Task Book validates all the user input before performing the update operation.
